# Practice-Landing-Page
Baby's first landing page.

Please forgive (or fully embrace) the silliness of this project. I took the concept of creating a basic landing page, and decided to theme it a little as a sales website for Mr. Meeseeks, a character from a popular adult-cartoon show, without ever fully theming the page.
